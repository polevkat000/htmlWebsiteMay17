    <h3>Fast Facts</h3>

    <ul>
      <p>Orcas...</p>
      <li>gained their common name from sailors, who witnessed them preying on larger whales</li>
      <li>have a Spanish translation for their common name, <i>ballena asesina</i>, which translates to <i>"assassin whale"</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Threats</h3>
    <p>Common threats to Orcas are often not given enough attention. In the 1900s, whale capturing reached a high. Entertainment companies, such as Sea World, captured Orcas from the wild to train them and perform for the public. In 1976, however, this trend began declining- Sea World agreed to end this capture cycle. Toxic chemicals, leading to lack of food, and the general inavailability of their regular diet, causes a major distress among Orca whale researchers.
